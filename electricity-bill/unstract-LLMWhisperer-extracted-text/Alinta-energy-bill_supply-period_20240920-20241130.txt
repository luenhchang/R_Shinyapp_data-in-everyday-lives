Dear Su, 

Your Electricity bill covers a longer period than usual 

We're reaching out to let you know that there's been a delay in getting your Electricity bill to you, because of this it 
covers a longer period of 72 days. If you receive Alinta Energy discounts as part of your energy plan, please be assured 
that these will still apply. 

Need more time to pay? 

Please know that you still have the usual amount of time to pay, however if you need more time, you can request a 
payment extension online anytime within MyAccount or by visiting alintaenergy.com.au/paymentextension. 

Alternatively, if you need additional long term payment assistance or support, visit alintaenergy.com.au/ 
paymentassistance for more information. Or if you'd like to discuss what options are available over the phone, simply 
call 13 37 02 - we'd be happy to help and are available Monday to Friday 8am - 6pm and 8am - 12pm (AEDT) on 
Saturdays. 

We sincerely apologise for the delay and for any inconvenience this has caused. 

Kind regards, 

The Alinta Energy Team
