This webpage automatically analyses my Strava activities. To analyse your own data, first log into your Strava account on the [Strava web service](https://www.strava.com/) and perform a [Bulk Export](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export#h_01GG58HC4F1BGQ9PQZZVANN6WF). Strava will then send you a link via email to download the export. This export contains all your uploaded data and comes in a large .zip file. The file you need to upload is **activities.csv**, which contains all your activity records. Uploading any other file may result in errors, but it provides a valuable opportunity for me to adjust my code to work with various users' data.
