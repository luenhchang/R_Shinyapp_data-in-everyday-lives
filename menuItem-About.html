<p><font size="5"><span style="color:#0B1215"> <strong>Data in Everyday
Lives</strong> offers a dynamic dashboard, showcasing and dissecting
data gathered from my daily activities, spanning from grocery runs and
item usage to recycling habits and fitness routines. </span></font></p>
<div id="food" class="section level2">
<h2>Food</h2>
<p><font size="5"><span style="color:#352f36"> My <strong>food</strong>
section initially began by tabulating barcode scans of select items.
Now, it has evolved to include tracking expiration dates, usage, and
pricing for all barcode-labelled products in my pantry and refrigerator.
Ever found yourself wondering about expiring items or stock quantities?
Or calculating the optimal purchase amount for discounted staples?
Monitoring your grocery status could be the key to reducing food waste.

<div id="bathroom" class="section level2">
<h2>Bathroom</h2>
<p><font size="5"><span style="color:#0C0C0C"> The
<strong>bathroom</strong> section is simpler than the food tracking. It
all started when I struggled to answer a basic question: How much
unopened dental floss do I have? This simple dilemma prompted me to
track my personal care essentials like dental floss, tooth paste, soap
and toilet paper. Now, I can confidently assess my stock in my phone and
make informed decisions, especially when faced with tempting discounts.

<div id="recycling" class="section level2">
<h2>Recycling</h2>
<p><font size="5"><span style="color:#101720"> The
<strong>recycling</strong> part is designed to monitor collections and
refunds through Queensland’s Containers for Change program. Driven by
personal interest, seek to track the quantities of plastic bottles,
beverage cans, glass bottles and cartons in my possession. Upon taking
these containers to the recycling centre, I compare my counts with those
registered by the facility. Current inventory is calculated by
aggregating counts across the three container types, resetting the tally
to zero after each refund, assuming the entire stock is returned for
recycling. </span></font></p>
</div>
<div id="fitness" class="section level2">
<h2>Fitness</h2>
<p><font size="5"><span style="color:#031602"> The
<strong>Fitness</strong> section analyses activity data sourced from the
Strava web service. I am currently enhacing its capabilities to handle
activity and single-event data uploaded by users other than myself.
</span></font></p>
</div>
<div id="jobs" class="section level2">
<h2>Jobs</h2>
<p><font size="5"> The <strong>Jobs</strong> section is tailored to
monitor the progress of job applications. One of the primary data
challenges lies in the ambiguity surroundings the start and end times of
job-related events. Nonetheless, currently, it proves valuable to track
the duration elapsed since the submission of a job application. Login is

</div>
<div id="internet" class="section level2">
<h2>Internet</h2>
<p><font size="5"> The <strong>Internet</strong> section was born out of
frustration with fluctuating WiFi speeds at home. Constantly let down by
various network providers, I could not determine if the sluggish
internet was due to poor reception or VPN content filtering. To unravel
this myself, I began running speed test in My Telstra app, capturing
screenshots, and storing them in a Google Drive folder. By extracting
text from these images and extracting date and time information from
file names, I have gained insights into speed fluctuations. Now, I am
expanding this section to include hourly test results from 6AM and 11PM.
To streamline user experience, the <a href="https://luenhchang.shinyapps.io/internet-speed-test/">Internet
speed test</a> is hosted separately from this site. While processing
images may slow down smartphone users, desktop users will not encounter
any issues.<br />

<div id="data-challenges" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Challenges</h2>
<p><font size="5"> In the <strong>Data Challenges</strong> section, I
showcase programming techniques used to generate the visualisations
featured in the sections above. </font></p>

<div id="crime-trends-in-queensland" class="section level2">
<h2>Crime trends in Queensland</h2>
<p><font size="5"> The <strong>[Queensland Crime Trends]</strong>(<a href="https://luenhchang.shinyapps.io/data-gov-au_police/" class="uri">https://luenhchang.shinyapps.io/data-gov-au_police/</a>)
project visualises changes in offence numbers from 2001 to 2021 using
