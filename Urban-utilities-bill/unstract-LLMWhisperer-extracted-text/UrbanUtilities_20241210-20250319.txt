To our valued customers, 

We hope you and your family stayed safe during the recent severe weather. 

Enclosed is your bill for the current billing period. It may be arriving a bit later 
than normal, as we paused billing while the weather event was in progress. 

Difficult times can put people under unexpected financial stress, but we're 
here to help. 

We want you to know that we have a range of options, including payment 
extensions, if you need some extra support during this time. 

The quickest and simplest way to see our support options, request a payment 
plan or extension is to visit urbanu.com.au/CycAlfredSupport. 

Or you can also chat with us via web chat to discuss your situation or                          QUUR68_A4B/E-1/S-2/1-3 
find out more.
