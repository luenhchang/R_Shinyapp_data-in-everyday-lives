<p><font size="5"> This webpage automatically analyses my Strava
activities. To analyse your own data, first log into your Strava account
on the <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava web service</a> and
perform a <a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export#h_01GG58HC4F1BGQ9PQZZVANN6WF">Bulk
Export</a>. Strava will then send you a link via email to download the
export. This export contains all your uploaded data and comes in a large
.zip file. The file you need to upload is
<strong>activities.csv</strong>, which contains all your activity
records. Uploading any other file may result in errors, but it provides
a valuable opportunity for me to adjust my code to work with various
usersâ€™ data. </font></p>
