Accelagen,Senior statistical programmer,NA,feedback provided,2024-10-09,"Hello Chang, Thank you for taking the time to interview with us. I was hoping you would reach out for feedback because you interviewed well and it was a positive experience. During the interview, you demonstrated great communication skills, an understanding of the requirements of a statistical programmer and a willingness to learn. Although I was impressed with your interview, the senior statistical programmer role requires more experience. To help with a future role at this level, I would encourage you to continue developing your CDISC knowledge, particularly with ADaM datasets, define.XMLs and Reviewer Guides. I wish you all the luck in the future! Thanks, Rebecca Rebecca Asher​​​​ Head of Biostatistics"

Your written application addressed the success criteria and demonstrated strong technical skills and data processing, visualisation and statistical analysis experience. For the interview, the panel was concerned that you provided four code examples where one was requested and that these examples were all much longer than the requested length of up to two pages. The panel also noted that while the comments in your code indicated what the code did, there was no explanation for why. The panel was concerned that you had failed to notice all of the questions provided in the perusal period. You did not provide sufficient detail in your response to the question on communication and working in project teams. For the question on using the data provided to create a survey contact list, the panel felt that your response did not identify all of the key considerations. I hope this helps and wish you the best of luck in future. Regards, Sylvia.
